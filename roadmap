connection system
-defined by possible connections
-will always be units of transportation
-will be composed of object vectors grouped by connectors
-connectors will be grouped by systems
-each system will be held by reference in a collection

	-> conveyor belts
	-> electricity
	-> pipes for liquids/gases
	-> pipes for items

multiblock system
-define by schematics and dimensions
-blocks and their formspecs?
-inventories being linked? / input/output blocks
